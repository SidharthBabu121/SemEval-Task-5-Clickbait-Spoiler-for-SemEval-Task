They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun\u2019s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it\u2019s a \"copy\" or \"duplicate,\" and it is illegal. Assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in Massachusetts.", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "f8ecbcac-fd2a-4d12-8ebe-ea9c03118c74", "targetParagraphId": 7, "postText": "BREAKING: This State Just Banned the Sale of ALL Semi-Auto Rifles, Effective Immediately", "targetTitle": "BREAKING: This State Just Banned the Sale of ALL Semi-Auto Rifles, Effective Immediately", "targetParagraph": "In the face of utter inaction by Congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence.

My acne was cystic, red, sore and I had bumps underneath my skin. I felt like I wanted to give up at this point. I then decided to give my diet one last change before I would have seen a dermatologist. I took pictures of my skin so I could see the results as to whether what I was doing was working or not and I started seeing the difference day by day. I wanted to share with you the realism of what people go through. Unfortunately acne isn't seen as normal and is thought as 'ugly' but it's something so many of us experience. It's nothing to be ashamed of. What is to be ashamed of is the perception of what we are supposed to look like. The picture on the right is my skin today! My scars are being treated with natural skincare products that I have found work my skin and I do want to avoid having any treatments to get rid of them. They need time to heal and I'm okay with that. Whatever journey your on to clear you skin don't give up on yourself.

Remember that everyone has there struggles in life. Most of us choose not share them. Most people with acne don't share it because there ashamed but why should we it's only a stage in our life it won't last forever and it certainly doesn't make us any less of a person. Clear skin or acne you are the same person. I get asked how can I be confident when my skin looks like this? The reason I decided to accept myself for how I looked is because for years I suffered with acne and for years I let my mental health take over, ruin relationships, stop me going out ect all because I was insecure and worried about other people's opinions. Because let's be honest acne isn't nice to look at. I knew I couldn't carry on being this hard on myself to the point I would cry and have a lot of built up stress causing headaches. I thought about the days when I used to have no worries when I was younger and here's what I came up with- I wasn't living life trying to impress anyone I wore no makeup so never felt less beautiful I didn't spend my time trying to make myself look perfect I didn't sit at home comparing myself to others on Instagram It's the world we live in today that makes us think like this. I don't want young girls feeling the same way I did. I don't want them to think they have to look a certain way to be accepted or beautiful. They need more role models embracing there real natural selfs because that is real life. I know how hard it can be but please please practice self love and believe in yourself this alone will make you feel better \ud83d\udc9b\ud83c\udf38\u2728 ------------------------------------------------", "spoilerType": "passage", "spoilerPos": [[56, 124]]}, {"uuid": "1fdf71e8-ec14-4c3b-a7c5-ca678c6f8ccb", "targetParagraphId": 2, "postText": "This beauty queen cured her acne with one diet change", "targetTitle": "UK beauty queen cured her severe acne with one simple diet trick", "targetParagraph": "A beauty pageant contestant has taken to Instagram to share the one thing that helped clear up her aggressive acne.", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "1fdf71e8-ec14-4c3b-a7c5-ca678c6f8ccb", "targetParagraphId": 11, "postText": "This beauty queen cured her acne with one diet change", "targetTitle": "UK beauty queen cured her severe acne with one simple diet trick", "targetParagraph": "I just wanted to share with you all a little study that I found out!!

ever beat Windows at PC gaming?", "targetParagraph": "FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project\u2019s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD\u2019s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host\u2019s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux.

In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to \"monopolize\" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there\u2019s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve\u2019s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn\u2019t help that a number of companies still haven\u2019t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system\u2019s handicaps. There\u2019s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10.

We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn\u2019t have what it takes to make our marriage work \u2013 and we\u2019re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn\u2019t our worst fight? What if there\u2019s a worse one ahead of us and we don\u2019t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, 'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn\u2019t get worse.' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage \u2013 an age old trick \u2013 unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" \u2013 and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization. I realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box \u2013 they were within us.\" # LoveWhatMatters Love What Matters Original Story Submitted by Kathy Gunn See More 14K 680 3.1K", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "49710fcc-8d5f-42df-a59a-d6036de1adb9", "targetParagraphId": 7, "postText": "Couple Waited 9 Years to Unwrap Wedding Gift That Read 'Do Not Open Until 1st Disagreement'", "targetTitle": "Wedding Gift Opened After 9 Years At First Disagreement : People.com", "targetParagraph": "No offense to your Vitamix, but it's safe to say that this is the greatest wedding gift of all time.Although Kathy and Brandon Gunn have been married since Sept. 1, 2007, they still had one wedding that they hadn't opened \u2013 until this May. Kathy wrote a post explaining why they'd waited to open the gift, which was from her great Aunt Alison and was attached to a note that read, \"Do not open until your first disagreement.\"\"Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years,\" she wrote in the post , which was shared by the page Love What Matters on August 29. \"There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box.\"Kathy admits that they'd avoided opening the box after all these years because they thought it would have symbolized a failure. \"To us, it would have meant that we didn't have what it takes to make our marriage work \u2013 and we're both to stubborn and determined for that,\" she wrote. \"So it forced us to reassess situations.

What if there's a worse one ahead of us and we don't have our box?!\"In May, after almost a decade and three moves, they finally decided to open the box, and found two hand-written notes wrapped around some cash, as well as wine glasses and bath products. The note to Kathy told her to buy pizza (\"or something you both like\") and prepare a bath, and the note to Brandon said, \"Go get flowers and a bottle of wine.\"In the end, Kathy wrote that they had been enjoying this gift for almost a decade, even though the box \u2013 which she calls \"the greatest wedding gift of all\" \u2013 hadn't been opened.\"I realized that the tools for creating a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box \u2013 they were within us.\"In an interview with PEOPLE, Kathy opened up about how their story has inspired other couples.\"My husband and I are in awe of how much attention this story has garnered,\" she says. \"I had only intended to give credit to my great aunt and share how important the box was for my husband and I \u2013 and the lessons that it had inadvertently taught us. Now that our story has gotten so much attention and has inspired others, it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving!\"As for her wise great aunt, Kathy says, \"She is just tickled by how much attention this has gotten \u2013 how many people have shared that they wish they had an 'Aunt Alison' and those that think her gift was absolutely genius.

Shelves will be stocked with inexpensive \"loss leaders,\" like pencils and paper to get you in the door. But retailers count on you to also purchase full-priced items with high profit margins \u2014 like binders, graph paper and computer memory sticks, according to Time.com. It\u2019s an exciting time for kids, and it\u2019s easy to get tempted into buying all the new things. Consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school.

In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don\u2019t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn\u2019t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn\u2019t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn\u2019t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War\u2014amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day.", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "2fa7e33c-5e68-4153-bf75-f226d9abe08f", "targetParagraphId": 2, "postText": "Is there a better way to observe Veteran's Day?", "targetTitle": "Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?", "targetParagraph": "Differences in how military holidays are observed can\u2019t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America\u2019s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn\u2019t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America\u2019s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date\u2014and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone\u2014one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America\u2019s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS\u2019s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world\u2014and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement.", "spoilerType": "passage", "spoilerPos": [[2198, 2370]]}, {"uuid": "2fa7e33c-5e68-4153-bf75-f226d9abe08f", "targetParagraphId": 0, "postText": "Is there a better way to observe Veteran's Day?", "targetTitle": "Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?", "targetParagraph": "Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "6765ec27-3811-4f36-a4a5-730aafe5ca14", "targetParagraphId": 11, "postText": "Why it's definitely worth it to get your flu shot", "targetTitle": "Why It's Worth It To Get Your Flu Shot", "targetParagraph": "What's new this year, says Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer at the CDC, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past.

In fact, his mere presence is enough to get most people excited about a movie, but did you know he was actually in one of the biggest flops of 2015? In fact, the movie made so little that almost no one even knows the film exists. Click over to the next page for the full story. As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn\u2019t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later. Morgan Freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.Appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers , Morgan Freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.While the original title of Stephen King\u2019s novelladoesn\u2019t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Morgan Freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter thanend up getting cut off. Morgan Freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has Rita Hayworth\u2019s name, which is something, although it\u2019s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.While we\u2019ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for The Shawshank Redemption we do know that the title they chose didn\u2019t help. In the long run, however, fans find great movies and they eventually did find, making it one of the most popular films ever made.

They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.

It was an interview with Tapp\u2019s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand?

They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler!

The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. \"We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the \u2018event horizon,\u2019 apparently the laws of physics begin to change.\" What does dying feel like? Despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying\u2014the last few days or moments\u2014remains shrouded in mystery. Medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * Until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. But modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. Now, Americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s most recent figures, Americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. \"Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.\" For those who do die gradually, there\u2019s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life\u2014a phase known as \"active dying.\" During this time, Hallenbeck writes in Palliative Care Perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. \"First hunger and then thirst are lost. Speech is lost next, followed by vision. The last senses to go are usually hearing and touch.\"", "spoilerType": "passage", "spoilerPos": [[30, 200], [1632, 1716], [2048, 2180]]}, {"uuid": "957d0be7-11dc-4ca4-9b65-bbbf9d151523", "targetParagraphId": 3, "postText": "What It Feels Like to Die", "targetTitle": "What It Feels Like to Die", "targetParagraph": "Whether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. \"There are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable,\" Campbell says. \"There are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there\u2019s no distress.\" Having a disease associated with pain doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. Most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, Campbell notes\u2014and the medicine usually works. \"If they\u2019re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully,\" she says. When people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. The sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. But that\u2019s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. In fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon\u2014which is commonly called a death rattle\u2014probably doesn\u2019t hurt. Ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it\u2019s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. \"We generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you\u2019re not really responsive, that your perception\u2014how you feel about things\u2014may also be significantly decreased,\" says David Hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. \"You may or may not even be aware of what\u2019s happening.\"", "spoilerType": "passage", "spoilerPos": [[77, 136], [1115, 1314]]}, {"uuid": "957d0be7-11dc-4ca4-9b65-bbbf9d151523", "targetParagraphId": 4, "postText": "What It Feels Like to Die", "targetTitle": "What It Feels Like to Die", "targetParagraph": "* * * A week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. When she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. Her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. I wanted to know what she was thinking about. I wanted to know where her mind was. Being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. Is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? Is her mind gone? For many dying people, \"the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival,\" says David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center. He compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: People tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills\u2014and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. \"The waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea.\" \"As the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system,\" Hovda explains. \"And so that\u2019s where people begin to see light.\"", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "957d0be7-11dc-4ca4-9b65-bbbf9d151523", "targetParagraphId": 6, "postText": "What It Feels Like to Die", "targetTitle": "What It Feels Like to Die", "targetParagraph": "* * * In her last couple of weeks, when my mother\u2019s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers.

In fact, researchers led by Christopher Kerr at a hospice center outside Buffalo, New York, conducted a study of dying people\u2019s dreams. Most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. And those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. For one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. The \"patients\u2019 pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality,\" the researchers write in the Journal of Palliative Medicine. Seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. Fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere. Twenty-eight percent dreamed about meaningful experiences in the past. (Patients were interviewed every day, so the same people often reported dreams about multiple subjects.) For most of the patients, the dreams were comforting and positive.

Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: Just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. While scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. The neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. \"A lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain,\" she says. \"They see lights and then they describe the experience as \u2018realer than real.\u2019\" She realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. Borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. They anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. \"Suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized,\" she says. The rats\u2019 brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence\u2014the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. \"If you\u2019re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face\u2014when you\u2019re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up,\" Borjigin says. \"These are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans.

However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I'm super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to \"think like a hacker\" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort\u2019s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from \u2018lasting more than a year\u2019. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term\u2019s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn\u2019t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn\u2019t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall\u2019s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet.

But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle\u2019s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\".

Historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older, and they still do with about 127 cases per 100,000 compared with 118 cases per 100,000 black women. However, incidence rates are now converging among white and African-American women, particularly among those aged 50 years to 59 years. \"Although the incidence haven't declined, we have made strides in the effort to improve the survival rate. Death rates have declined by 34 percent since 1990. However, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival,\" Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told HealthDay . Breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, while African-American women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial/ethnic group. In June, a JAMA study showed that black women are less likely to survive a breast cancer diagnosis within five years because they undergo fewer screenings, have poorer health at the time of diagnosis and have more advanced disease by the time the cancer is found. Authors of of the ACS report also noted that reproductive history and obesity are more strongly linked to ER-positive breast cancer, the form of the disease more common among white women, while lower socioeconomic status has been linked to raised risk for ER-negative breast cancer, which is more common among African Americans.", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "3e811c22-4cd1-4ded-97b0-e1fc5a51d45c", "targetParagraphId": 0, "postText": "Breast cancer rates are on the rise among these women", "targetTitle": "Breast Cancer Rates On The Rise In Black Women, And More Health News This Week", "targetParagraph": "Breast Cancer Rates On The Rise In Black Women, And More Health News This Week", "spoilerType": null, "spoilerPos": null}, {"uuid": "3e811c22-4cd1-4ded-97b0-e1fc5a51d45c", "targetParagraphId": 1, "postText": "Breast cancer rates are on the rise among these women", "targetTitle": "Breast Cancer Rates On The Rise In Black Women, And More Health News This Week", "targetParagraph": "Breast Cancer Rates On The Rise Among Black Women", "spoilerType": "phrase", "spoilerPos": [[38, 49]]}, {"uuid": "189cf18d-1b1f-4a50-8f79-950bb218c5d0", "targetParagraphId": 1, "postText": "You've never heard the f-word this much in your entire life", "targetTitle": "All The F-Words In 'The Wolf Of Wall Street'", "targetParagraph": "Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" features a lot of swear words.

These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer. Nitrosamines have been linked to bladder cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer.Data from the American Institute for Cancer Research shows that people who consume a single corn dog daily have a 21% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer.
